# EZRaffle

This is an easy to use application for administering raffles.

## What it does

Enter entrant's name, email, phone number, and number of entries and the entrant will be added to the raffle database. Entrants will also receive an email confirming their entries. You can view all entrants from the "View" tab, as well as pick a winner from the "Pick" tab.

## Why

I created this program to save time filling out raffle tickets and hopefully you find this useful for your needs.

## How

EZRaffle is written in C# as a WinForms application that utilizes a lightweight SQLite database contained in the applications folder.
